            <h2>Meal Planning App Prototype</h2>

            <p>For my design spotlight, I created a prototype for a meal planning app using Figma.  
               The app is designed to help users plan their meals for the week, generate shopping lists,  
               and discover new recipes based on their dietary preferences. The prototype includes a  
               user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, allowing users to easily add meals,  
               view nutritional information, and customize their meal plans. Below is an image of the  
               Figma prototype showcasing the main screens of the app.</p>

                <p>The choice of colors for my meal app—Pearl Beige (#EFE3BA for the background),  
                   Willow Green (#A3DB6C for secondary elements), and Red (#FF0000 for primary features)  
                   was made to create a natural and appetizing user experience. Pearl Beige provides a  
                   neutral, calming backdrop that evokes grains and bread, giving the interface a clean,  
                   less overwhelming feel. Willow Green was selected to evoke a sense of freshness, health,  
                   and the natural qualities of vegetables and herbs, which aligns with the app's focus on  
                   wholesome food choices. The color Red is inspired by ripe fruits and tomatoes, stimulating  
                   the appetite and enhancing user engagement. Together, these colors create a warm, intuitive,  
                   and visually appealing design that is easy to navigate and promotes healthy eating.  </p>
