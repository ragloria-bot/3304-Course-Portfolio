            I utilized the developer tools available in my web  
            browser to temporarily modify the Texas Tech University  
            homepage for a fun experiment. During this process, I  
            made several changes, including adjustments to the text,  
            images, and layout of the site. Below is a screenshot that  
            captures these alterations. It's important to note that  
            these edits were purely cosmetic and only visible on my  
            computer; they did not have any impact on the actual website  
            or its content. This exercise allowed me to explore web  
            design elements and how they can be manipulated in real-time.

        <h2>My "Vandalized" Website</h2>
        <p>
            While experimenting with the developer tools, I made several
            notable changes to the Texas Tech University homepage. I altered
            the main headline to read "READY TO BECOME A BROWN TATAER?" to add a  
            humorous touch. Additionally, I changed the "h2" subheading to
            "Start your journey to bring a TATER right here", along with changing 
            the font size and height. I also modified the image in the background 
            to feature a playful potato-themed graphic, replacing the original 
            university imagery. I also changed the color of the button, the color 
            of the embedded message button, the background color of the logo, replaced 
            the logo with the letter "P" for potato, and the color of the element on 
            element "a". These changes were made purely for fun and to explore the 
            capabilities of developer tools.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>What text did you edit?</strong>  
                The main headline to "READY TO BECOME A BROWN TATAER?" and the 
                subheading to "Start your journey to bring a TATER right here".
            </li>
            <li><strong>What CSS properties did you modify?</strong>  
                Font size, height, button color, background color of the logo, 
                and color of the element on element "a".
            </li>
            <li><strong>What made your edits interesting or amusing?</strong>  
                The humorous twist of changing the university theme to a potato-themed 
                design made the edits amusing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't?</strong>  
                Yes, I understood that some changes required specific CSS properties 
                to be targeted correctly in order to take effect.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Why did you choose the changes you did?</strong>  
                I chose changes that would create a humorous and lighthearted 
                version of the Texas Tech University homepage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made?</strong>  
                Yes, I was able to see how HTML elements are styled using CSS, 
                and how modifying CSS properties can change the appearance of those elements.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages?</strong>  
                Yes, this exercise gave me a practical understanding of how developer tools 
                can be used to experiment with and refine web design in real-time.
