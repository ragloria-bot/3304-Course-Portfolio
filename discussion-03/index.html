            Plate Mate is a mobile and web application designed to simplify meal management by offering a  
            personalized experience. Users input their preferences, dietary restrictions, and culinary skills,  
            allowing the app to suggest tailored recipes, meal plans, and grocery lists.

            The app also features a food discovery section, "Browse Recipes," that encourages users to explore  
            new recipes, cooking techniques, and global culinary trends, transforming meal preparation into an  
            enjoyable activity.

            <h2> Core Problem and Solution:</h2>

            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p>Many face challenges with preparing healthy meals at home, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>    
        
                1. Time-consuming meal planning:  Finding new, healthy recipes can be burdensome.
                2. Lack of inspiration:  Repetitive meals reduce motivation to cook.
                3. Fragmented tools: Managing multiple apps for recipes and grocery lists is inefficient.
                </li>
            </ul>   

            <h2>Solution:</h2> 
           <p>Plate Mate integrates these functions into a single platform, providing personalized meal  
            plans and a dynamic recipe library tailored to user preferences and dietary needs. </p>

            <h2> User Flow:</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                1. Sign-In/Account Creation:  New users can create an account by entering their full  
                name, email address, and password. If you already have an account, simply sign in.

                2. Account Holder Preferences:  After signing up, new users will set up their profile.  
                They need to specify dietary preferences (like vegetarian or gluten-free), list any  
                allergies, and choose favorite cuisines. Users will also select their cooking experience  
                level, preferred cuisines, and meal plan preferences for certain meal times. Don’t forget  
                to indicate how many people you are cooking for, as the recipes will adjust accordingly.

                3. Navigation Menu: Upon preferences submission, users will see a navigation menu to access  
                their personalized "Meal Plan," which includes two recipe options for each meal. They can  
                also create a "Grocery List," adjust their "Meal Preferences," or "Browse Recipes" beyond  
                their personalized meal plan.

                4.  Meal Plan:  By clicking the "Meal Plan" button, users go to their personalized 7-day  
                meal plan with two recipe options for every meal.
                5. Ingredients/Instructions:  Once a recipe is chosen, the user will receive a list of  
                ingredients and cooking instructions.

                6. Grocery List:  Users can access their "Grocery List" anytime to add items they need.

                7. Navigation Buttons:  At the top and bottom of each screen, the user is provided with  
                options to navigate throughout the app with ease.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Justification of a Specific Design Decision:</h2>

            <p>Design Decision: A clear, easy-to-use search and filtering system is included in the "Navigation Menu".

            Justification: This decision meets a key user need for efficiency and personalization.</p>
