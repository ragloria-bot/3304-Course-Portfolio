            <strong>Greetings from Altus, Oklahoma!</strong> My name is Ramona Gloria.  
            I am a non-traditional student, meaning I'm a 43-year-old  student trying  
            to finish what I started over 20 years ago. I have been happily married to  
            my spouse for 20 years. I have two children: a daughter who is currently  
            attending OSU to become a Veterinarian, and my son, who is in heaven. This  
            past May of 2025, I graduated from WOSC with a double major in Business  
            Administration and Liberal Arts. My original credits were for a computer  
            science degree, but my local community college no longer offered that degree,  
            so I took a different direction. Midway through completing my associate's  
            degree, I wanted to shift my focus more towards the computer side than the  
            business side. Texas Tech was the only state university that offered a  
            bachelor's degree I wanted online, and Tech is my favorite college team.  
            Honestly, starting at Texas Tech has been so intimidating for me, even  
            though my courses are online. However, upon reflection, everything that  
            was initially new to me felt the same way until I became accustomed to  
            the new environment. One of my interests is interior design. I love  
            creating personal environments within a home that function well but also  
            express the resident's personality.  

            My picture is not of a thing but of my daughter and me graduating, both  
            with double majors from WOSC this past spring. She is very important to me,  
            not only because she's my daughter, but also my reason to live and strive  
            to be better than I was yesterday. She has motivated me as a person, a woman,  
            and a mother to do my best in everything, to go big or go home. Throughout  
            her childhood to the present time, I made it a point to encourage her never  
            to give up, no matter the adversity. Before finishing her senior year of high  
            school, the very words I had repeatedly lectured her with resounded in my ears,  
            and the thought came to mind: "You let adversity get in the way of your dream.  
            These words were so loud, and I felt like a hypocrite telling my daughter never  
            to give up when I had done that very thing and hid behind excuses for so many  
            years. So here I am, regardless of adversity, pursuing my dream.  

            One interesting thing about myself is that I have had an interest in avionics  
            since I was a young adult and completed trade school in 2004 as an avionics  
            simulation mechanic. For several years, I worked as a Simulator Technician for  
            Flight Safety on the C-5 and KC-135 trainers, based locally where I reside. My  
            goal is to return to Flight Safety with enhanced knowledge and skills in computer  
            applications. This company and field of work continually create opportunities for  
            learning and new technology, which are essential for staying current with the  
            latest advancements.
