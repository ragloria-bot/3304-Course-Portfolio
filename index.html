INSTRUCTIONS: HOW TO CHANGE THIS PAGE:

1. Change "Student Name" in the title above to your real name.

2. Change "Your Name" in the big heading below to your real name.

3. Change "your-username" to your real GitHub username in both links.

4. Change "your-repo-name" to the name of this repository.

5. Change "Course Name" to the name of your class.

6. Change "Semester Year" to match when you are taking this class.

7. Add links to your work:
    - Find the words that say "Exercise 01", "Assignment 01", etc.
    - Between the quote marks in href="", put the relative link to your work in the subfolder. You can simply link to the subfolder name. Take a look at the example folders and links to see how to do this.
    - For work not yet started/completed, you can leave the href="" blank until you are ready.
    - Change the words "Exercise 01" to match the name of the exercise. Do the same for assignments and projects. If you add your discussion posts, do the same for them.
    - Do this for each piece of work you finish.

8. You can add more links by copying a whole line like this:
    <li><a href="">New Work Name</a></li>
    Then paste it below the last one in that section.

9. Save your changes and push to GitHub when you are done. Remember you can use GitHub Desktop to help you with this.

Remember: During the course, if you want, you can style your homepage to introduce your own style and aesthetics. To start, keep this page simple and plain. This is just a template to get you started. Embrace the handcrafted approach to web design and development: change things to make them your own.

Remember: You must have a GitHub account, a new GitHub repository for this course, and this file (index.html) in that repository. 

Remember: You must create subfolders for each piece of coursework as the semester progresses.
