            https://www.hulu.com/hub/homeLinks to an external site.

            I chose hulu.com as my website of choice to inspect and identify a specific  
            element, describing how it utilizes the CSS Box Model, including padding,  
            and how the site leverages Flexbox to achieve its layout. The first element  
            I chose was the main preview area of tending movies/shows, which is the  
            yellow-highlighted box ("div class="eo2gsvf eo2gsve _1fbaspu6 _1fbaspu5   
            _1fbaspu1g _1fbaspu10 _1fbaspu29").  Now, within the yellow area is a  
            grayish-blue box containing the media information and the lower-right-hand  
            corner logo; the padding is adjusted to 64px. This gives the media information  
            and the logo in the right-hand corner space of 64px from the bottom of the yellow box.

        <p>
            Hulu utilizes a combination of CSS properties, integrating both Flexbox and CSS Grid  
            layout systems to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The majority of  
            this website utilizes the Flexbox "align-items" property to ensure vertical centering  
            of elements within containers, like text next to an image in a media object style  
            component. The highlighted sections in lime-green notation indicates that the text  
            and elements are aligned center for better visibility to the audience.
