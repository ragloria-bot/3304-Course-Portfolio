            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Greetings, my name is Ramona Gloria. I am currently enrolled as a full-time  
                student at Texas Tech University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree  
                in Computer Applications. As a long-time resident of southwestern Oklahoma,  
                I have always aspired to further my education, and I am pleased to be dedicated  
                to investing in my personal and professional development.  
                
                My background includes experience in mechanics for simulation systems within  
                avionics, during which I worked for Flight Safety for several years. I also  
                possess a solid foundation in warehouse logistics. My professional objective  
                is to re-enter the field of simulator technology, leveraging my enhanced skill  
                set in computer applications.</p>

                    One of my interests is Aviation Simulation Technology. From 2006 to 2011, I had  
                    the opportunity to travel to various locations for training and experience in this field.  
                    A memorable experience was learning to fly the KC-135 and C-5 simulators. Working on trainers
                    for these aircraft allowed me to develop a deep understanding of their systems and operations.  
                    Additionally, I had the chance to meet many skilled professionals during my assignments.

                <p class="description">
                    Disney World had always been a cherished dream of mine. Growing up  
                    in Florida, I longed to experience its magic but never had the chance  
                    due to financial struggles. When I became a parent, I wanted to give  
                    my daughter those special memories.

                    For her 5th birthday, I planned a 7-day trip to Disney World, staying  
                    at the beautiful Polynesian Resort, surrounded by lush gardens and  
                    tropical plants. Each day was filled with excitement as we explored the  
                    parks and met beloved characters. My daughter's eyes sparkled with joy,  
                    and every evening she would say, "Mom, this is the best day ever!" This  
                    trip was a wonderful opportunity to bond with her and finally share  
                    the magic I had always dreamed of.

                   Key West, Florida, is a captivating place with a distinct charm.

                <p class="description">
                    Freeport was a fascinating destination with its primary industry centered  
                    around oil storage, blending, and transshipment. The port area is dominated  
                    by an array of industrial equipment, which gives the surroundings a distinctly  
                    urban feel, somewhat overshadowing the natural beauty I had anticipated.  
                    Despite this industrial backdrop, what truly stood out to me were the locals.  
                    The people in Freeport were not only welcoming but also exuded a genuine  
                    humility that made my experience memorable. Their warmth and friendliness  
                    created a stark contrast to the heavy machinery around them, revealing a  
                    vibrant community that thrives amidst the industrial landscape. Overall,  
                    my time in Freeport offered a unique combination of industrial insight  
                    and heartfelt human connection.
