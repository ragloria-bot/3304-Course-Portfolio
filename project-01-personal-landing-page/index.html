            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Greetings, my name is Ramona Gloria. I am currently enrolled as a full-time  
                student at Texas Tech University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree  
                in Computer Applications. As a long-time resident of southwestern Oklahoma,  
                I have always aspired to further my education, and I am pleased to be dedicated  
                to investing in my personal and professional development.  
                
                My background includes experience in mechanics for simulation systems within  
                avionics, during which I worked for Flight Safety for several years. I also  
                possess a solid foundation in warehouse logistics. My professional objective  
                is to re-enter the field of simulator technology, leveraging my enhanced skill  
                set in computer applications.</p>

                    One of my interests is Aviation Simulation Technology. From 2006 to 2011, I had  
                    the opportunity to travel to various locations for training and experience in this field.  
                    A memorable experience was learning to fly the KC-135 and C-5 simulators. Working on trainers
                    for these aircraft allowed me to develop a deep understanding of their systems and operations.  
                    Additionally, I had the chance to meet many skilled professionals during my assignments.

                   Fishing is one of my favorite pastimes, especially when I get to share the

                   It's not just about the fish; it's about the quality time spent together,  
                   the stories shared, and the memories created. Whether we're casting our lines

                    Renovating homes is a hobby of mine that I truly enjoy. One of the most rewarding  
                    experiences I've had was during a trip to Freeport, Bahamas, where I participated
                    in a community renovation project. It was fulfilling to contribute my skills and see  
                    the tangible improvements we made to the homes. This experience not only enhanced my  
                    renovation skills but also deepened my appreciation for teamwork and community spirit.
