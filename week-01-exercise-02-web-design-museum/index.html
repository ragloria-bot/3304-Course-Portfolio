        <h1>Week 01 - Exercise 02 - Web Design Museum</h1>
        <p>This exercise directly relates to the video "A brief history of the World Wide Web."  
            By exploring a gallery of early websites, you will develop an eye for how design  
            and technology have evolved over time. My task was to find a site that interests  
            me and make a brief observation about it.
