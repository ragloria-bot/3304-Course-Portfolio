        <h1>Week 02 - Exercise 01 - Create and Deploy Your Course Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This single, comprehensive exercise requires you to run through the  
            entire setup and deployment process. By the end, you will have a  
            live, public URL that will serve as the central homepage for all  
            your coursework this semester.
