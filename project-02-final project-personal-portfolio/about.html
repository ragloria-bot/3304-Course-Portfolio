    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Greetings, my name is Ramona Gloria. I am currently enrolled as a full-time  
        student at Texas Tech University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree  
        in Computer Applications. As a long-time resident of southwestern Oklahoma,  
        I have always aspired to further my education, and I am pleased to be dedicated  
        to investing in my personal and professional development.  
        
        My background includes experience in mechanics for simulation systems within  
        avionics, during which I worked for Flight Safety for several years. I also  
        possess a solid foundation in warehouse logistics. My professional objective  
        is to re-enter the field of simulator technology, leveraging my enhanced skill  
        set in computer applications.
        
        Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects, skills,  
        and interests in the field of computer applications. I am enthusiastic about living  
        in the digital age and am eager to contribute to innovative solutions in this dynamic industry.
